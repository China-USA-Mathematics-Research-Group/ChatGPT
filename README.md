# DRAFT PROPOSAL FOR AMS REGIONAL---FRESNO, CA
Title: ChatGPT or ChatGPA? Exploring the role of AI in problem-solving and posing

In the following session, an algebraist (Zheng Yang) and a mathematics educator (Todd Edwards) explore classic recreational mathematics tasks (e.g., Lewis Carroll's Cats and Rats Problem) using ChatGPT and GeoGebra. 

As others have noted, ChatGPT is a language tool, not a computational engine. As such, ChatGPT generates genuinely interesting results when asked to solve mathematical tasks. "ChatGPT sometimes delivers insightful answers that would be a credit to an excellent Ph.D. student. Other times, however, it makes idiotic and obnoxious mistakes" (Thagard, 2023). Drawing on a vast collection of writing samples, ChatGPT relies on pattern recognition to predict what utterances are most probable. These writing samples include incorrect results that are, in turn, reflected in ChatGPT responses. 

Critics of ChatGPT (and AI, in general) point to faulty responses as evidence that ChatGPT has no place in learning classrooms. Such criticisms mistake ChatGPT as an answer generator (i.e., "ChatGPA") rather than as a learning partner---one that requires a human capable of asking useful questions in order to generate productive responses. Herein lies our challenge---First, to empower our students to ask more and better questions; and, Secondly, to help students learn how to communicate productively with the AI.

In our interactive session, we'll wrestle with these ideas as we engage ChatGPT as a learning partner. We'll ask ChatGPT to respond to audience-generated questions. We'll generate code and incorporate it in sample GeoGebra sketches. Moreover, we'll brainstorm ways to help our students learn how to communicate with AI productively, in order to build conceptual understanding of the mathematics they are studying. At the end of the session, participants will have: (1) a better understanding of ChatGPT, including its strengths and limitations; (2) a better sense of how to engage ChatGPT to generate productive output; and (3) ideas for incorporating ChatGPT with students in their own classrooms.

Title: ChatGPT or ChatGPA? Exploring AI's Role in Problem-Solving and Posing

In this session, an algebraist and a mathematics educator will demonstrate the use of ChatGPT and GeoGebra in solving classic recreational math problems, such as Lewis Carroll's Cats and Rats Problem.

While ChatGPT is primarily a language tool, it has shown the ability to deliver insightful answers to mathematical problems. However, it is not perfect and can sometimes generate incorrect responses. Critics have suggested that ChatGPT is not suitable for learning environments. We argue that ChatGPT is a learning partner that requires humans to ask useful questions to generate productive responses.

Our interactive session will explore how to empower students to ask better questions and how to communicate productively with AI. We will use ChatGPT to respond to audience-generated questions, generate code, and incorporate it into GeoGebra sketches. By the end of the session, participants will have a better understanding of ChatGPT's strengths and limitations, know how to engage ChatGPT to generate productive output, and have ideas for incorporating ChatGPT in their classrooms.
