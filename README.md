# DRAFT PROPOSAL FOR AMS REGIONAL---FRESNO, CA
Title: ChatGPT or ChatGPA? Exploring the role of AI in problem-solving and posing

In the following session, an algebraist (Zheng Yang) and a mathematics educator (Todd Edwards) explore classic recreational mathematics tasks (e.g., Lewis Carroll's Cats and Rats Problem) using ChatGPT and GeoGebra. As others have noted, ChatGPT---at its heart---is a language tool, not a computational engine. As such, ChatGPT generates genuinely interesting results when asked to solve mathematical tasks, including solutions that are incorrect. "ChatGPT sometimes delivers insightful answers that would be a credit to an excellent Ph.D. student. Other times, however, it makes idiotic and obnoxious mistakes" (Thagard, 2023). 

Drawing on a vast collection of writing samples, ChatGPT relies on pattern recognition to predict what utterances are most probable. These writing samples include incorrect mathematics that is reflected in ChatGPT responses. In our interactive session, we'll explore how to use this understanding of ChatGPT to engage students mathematically with the software. Rather than an answer generator, we envision ChatGPT as a learning partner---one that requires a human capable of asking questions that yield productive answers. In our interactive session, we'll ask ChatGPT audience-generated questions, generate code to use in GeoGebra sketches, and brainstorm ways that GeoGebra+ChatGPT can be used to promote conceptual understanding and deep thinking in mathematics classrooms.


# ChatGPT
This repository contains prompts for use with ChatGPT when exploring mathematics content.
We want to look for ways to use GPT and its variants to help us better understand mathematics.
