- In the following session, an algebraist (Zheng Yang) and a mathematics educator (Todd Edwards) explore classic recreational mathematics tasks (e.g., Lewis Carroll's Cats and Rats Problem) using ChatGPT and GeoGebra. 

- As others have noted, ChatGPT is a language tool, not a computational engine. As such, ChatGPT generates genuinely interesting results when asked to solve mathematical tasks. "ChatGPT sometimes delivers insightful answers that would be a credit to an excellent Ph.D. student. Other times, however, it makes idiotic and obnoxious mistakes" (Thagard, 2023). Drawing on a vast collection of writing samples, ChatGPT relies on pattern recognition to predict what utterances are most probable. These writing samples include incorrect results that are, in turn, reflected in ChatGPT responses. 

- Critics of ChatGPT (and AI, in general) point to faulty responses as evidence that ChatGPT has no place in learning classrooms. Such criticisms mistake ChatGPT as an answer generator (i.e., "ChatGPA") rather than as a learning partner---one that requires a human capable of asking useful questions in order to generate productive responses. Herein lies our challenge---First, to empower our students to ask more and better questions; and, Secondly, to help students learn how to communicate productively with the AI.

- In our interactive session, we'll wrestle with these ideas as we engage ChatGPT as a learning partner. We'll ask ChatGPT to respond to audience-generated questions. We'll generate code and incorporate it in sample GeoGebra sketches. Moreover, we'll brainstorm ways to help our students learn how to communicate with AI productively, in order to build conceptual understanding of the mathematics they are studying. At the end of the session, participants will have: (1) a better understanding of ChatGPT, including its strengths and limitations; (2) a better sense of how to engage ChatGPT to generate productive output; and (3) ideas for incorporating ChatGPT with students in their own classrooms.

- "Will we allow students to bring them into exams? Use them to do homework? How will the content of calculus courses be affected? Will we take the advice that we have been dispensing to teachers in the primary grades: that they should teach more of concepts and less of mechanics? What happens when $29.95 pocket computers can do all of the above and solve standard forms of differential equations, do multiple integrals, vector analysis, and what-have-you?

## General suggestions for crafting prompts that elicit sophisticated responses with GPT-4 (as suggested by GPT-4!):

1. Be specific: Clearly define the topic or concepts you want the model to address. This helps to narrow the scope of the response and ensures it focuses on the desired subject matter.
2. Request analysis or comparison: Encourage deeper thought by asking the model to analyze, compare, or contrast concepts, theories, or ideas. This will prompt the model to provide a more nuanced and detailed response.
3. Incorporate multiple perspectives: Request that the model explore different viewpoints or consider various implications related to the topic. This encourages a more comprehensive and balanced response.
4. Use academic or professional language: Phrasing your prompt using more formal language can signal to the model that you are seeking a well-reasoned, intellectual response.
5. Limit word count: By specifying a word limit, you can encourage the model to be concise and prioritize the most relevant information.
6. Remember, GPT-4's performance is still dependent on the quality of the input prompt. Experiment with different phrasings and approaches to refine the output and receive more sophisticated responses.

## Advanced Guide to Interacting with ChatGPT

I asked ChatGPT-4 to create an advanced guide using the following prompt:

> Create a fully comprehensive guide to interacting with ChatGPT specifically in the context of using effective prompts, priming, and use of personas. Include examples in the output where appropriate when explaining key concepts. The guide should help a person who is familiar with the basic concepts of prompts, priming and use of personas that is looking to gain advanced understanding of these topics to become more effective in the use of ChatGPT.

This is what it created:

#### Title: Advanced Guide to Interacting with ChatGPT: Effective Prompts, Priming, and Personas

1.  Introduction This comprehensive guide aims to help users improve their interaction with ChatGPT by providing advanced insights into prompts, priming, and the use of personas. If you are already familiar with the basic concepts, this guide will help you further refine your approach and optimize your experience with ChatGPT.
    
2.  Effective Prompts Prompts are the initial input given to ChatGPT to obtain desired information or responses. Crafting effective prompts can significantly improve the quality and relevance of the generated output.
    

#### 2.1. Be Specific and Clear Ensure your prompt is explicit and leaves little room for ambiguity. This helps ChatGPT understand your intent and provide a more focused response.

Example:

-   Basic: "Tell me about batteries."
-   Advanced: "Explain the working principle of lithium-ion batteries and their advantages over other battery types."

#### 2.2. Break Down Complex Questions For better results, divide complicated questions into smaller, simpler parts. This allows ChatGPT to provide more detailed answers for each aspect.

Example:

-   Basic: "Explain the history and impact of the internet."
-   Advanced (broken down): "Describe the invention of the internet," followed by, "Discuss the impact of the internet on society and economy."

#### 2.3. Use Contextual Clues Include contextual information in your prompts to guide ChatGPT towards the desired response.

Example:

-   Basic: "What was the outcome of the experiment?"
-   Advanced: "In the 1928 discovery of penicillin by Alexander Fleming, what was the outcome of the experiment and its significance in the field of medicine?"

#### 2.4. Request Step-by-Step Explanations When seeking complex or process-based answers, request step-by-step explanations to ensure the response is organized and easy to understand.

Example:

-   Basic: "How does photosynthesis work?"
-   Advanced: "Explain the process of photosynthesis in plants, breaking it down into its primary steps."

3.  Priming Priming is the technique of providing additional information to ChatGPT to influence its response. It helps in obtaining more accurate, relevant, or tailored answers.

#### 3.1. Set Expectations Begin your interaction by setting expectations, such as specifying the format or depth of the answer you desire.

Example:

-   Basic: "What are the benefits of yoga?"
-   Advanced: "List 5 physical and 5 mental benefits of practicing yoga regularly."

#### 3.2. Establish Context Provide context to your queries by specifying details such as time, place, or other relevant factors.

Example:

-   Basic: "What are the best practices in software development?"
-   Advanced: "What are the top 5 best practices in Agile software development methodologies?"

#### 3.3. Limit Response Length To ensure concise answers, set a constraint on the response length.

Example:

-   Basic: "Explain the role of mitochondria in cells."
-   Advanced: "In 100 words or less, describe the primary function of mitochondria in eukaryotic cells."

4.  Personas Personas are fictional identities assigned to ChatGPT to shape its responses. This can enhance the user experience by tailoring the output to specific styles, perspectives, or expertise levels.

#### 4.1. Define the Persona Begin by defining the persona's characteristics, such as profession, expertise, style, or tone.

Example:

-   Basic: "Explain quantum mechanics."
-   Advanced: "As a physics professor, explain the key principles of quantum mechanics to a college student."

#### 4.2. Specify Language and Tone Instruct ChatGPT to adopt a specific language style or tone to cater to your preferences or audience.

Example:

-   Basic: "Tell me about Shakespeare's works."
-   Advanced: "In a conversational tone, discuss the major themes present in Shakespeare's plays."

#### 4.3. Roleplay Scenarios Use personas in roleplay scenarios to generate unique and engaging content.

Example:

-   Basic: "How can I improve my negotiation skills?"
-   Advanced: "You are an expert negotiator. Roleplay a scenario where you teach me techniques to improve my negotiation skills."

#### 4.4. Combine Personas and Priming Integrate personas and priming to optimize the response and achieve a highly tailored output.

Example:

-   Basic: "What should I consider when starting a business?"
-   Advanced: "As a successful entrepreneur, provide a step-by-step guide on the essential factors to consider when starting a new business venture."

#### 5.  Conclusion 

Mastering effective prompts, priming, and personas will significantly improve your interactions with ChatGPT. By applying these advanced techniques, you will obtain more accurate, relevant, and engaging responses tailored to your needs.

Remember to:

-   Craft specific and clear prompts
-   Break down complex questions into smaller parts
-   Include contextual clues in your prompts
-   Request step-by-step explanations
-   Set expectations and establish context through priming
-   Limit response length when necessary
-   Define personas and specify language and tone
-   Use roleplay scenarios to create engaging content
-   Combine personas and priming for highly tailored outputs

By implementing these advanced strategies, you will become more effective in using ChatGPT and enjoy a highly customized and valuable experience.

## ChatGPT and big models conference (Beijing, 3/21/2023)
I’m going to summarize some of meeting (that I found pretty interesting), since I’m about to leave Beijing in an hour and before I forget too much of it. (I took lots of pictures, later I may try upload them in our GitHub.

**1) An example:** a dialog between two people involving same words “意思“ (pronounced :Yisi) appear in the conversation like 11 times, but the meanings are all different. Often this is hard to translate to English or interpret unless you know the Chinese language very well (perhaps culture too). But now ChatGPT (or GPT4) seems to explain the dialog in a much better way (although with some mistakes) than anything before.
— so how to train the language model (as GPT) is really a topic that people like to understand. Several talks mentioned that it’s not known how many parameters they used for GPT4. And it’s currently a huge gap between GPT4 and others (like the ones Chinese invented which are similar to it)
- They also compare this with GPT3, for example,
- Question:  How many eye does my foot have? 
- GPT3: Your foot has two eyes.

**2) Future direction of big model:** there are 3 items that are interrelated each other: a) complement the disadvantages of big models (see: augmented language models: a survey)  b) understand the engine (structure) of big models - encoder to decoder V.S Decoder? CoT mechanism. Need better evaluations for these models. C) World Scope (see Bisk 2020 paper). 


**3) Some Chinese version tools:** ChatImg, (on WeChat, can test) and GPT4 has not yet open the “vision” —multimodal AGI and multimodal ChatGPT? GPT4 has not provided us solutions.
- Chinese “bysearch 1.0” —- focus on “small model” rather than “big models”.
- Two “G”  since 2022— Generation (eg, Dall-E 2, Imagen, Stable Diffusion) 
- General ( eg, LaMDA, PalM, ChatGPT, GPT4)
— “If we learn language, we will learn thinking”.
- Propose: AGI 1 (currently, thinking machine) AGI 2 (memory, constantly learn from conversation) 
- AGI 3 (interact with physical world, make decisions) AGI 4 (by itself, can constantly think without inputs) 
- Chinese “IDEA-CCNL” NLU, NLG, NLT 
- MindBot-Lite (there’s a website)
- An example of RLHF (based on human feedback reinforced learning) 
- New paradigm: train a big model include all NLP tasks then the user just describe what they need
- “The world needs more AGI models (more and more parameters, like 1000B)

**4) Code representation model (code comprehension, code generation)**
- Demo of AiXcoder (by Peking University) 
- Full line code completion 
- Difference between natural language and program language 
- Q: Can we use different representations of programs to construct big models? (Confirmed effective in small models)
- What we can do is pull the big model into this complex environment to play its role (since software development happens in a complex environment and it’s difficult to transfer all the things to a big model)
- Big model has shown us the dawn of software development automation (still a long way to go)

**5) Mistakes of facts (Hallucination) - intrinsic and extrinsic**

- GPT4 has made more improvements than ChatGPT 
- (Better control, trust, safer, more close to human…)
- **White box vs black box (ZHENG, "White Box/Black Box" was one of the most important themes from my PhD disseration. The literature around this began with Bruno Buchberger back in 1989. Here's a link to his seminal article: https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/382276.1095228**
- Chinese “AI-Topia”
- ChatGPT core tech: prompt learning, instruction learning

**6) Chat Demo example of Biomedicine + AI**

- Drug design research (challenges: nonEuclidean data, graph network, notenough data label, insert domain knowledge, Engineering problems in big models)
- Chinese “PSG”-algorithm  OGB competition 
- Chinese “ChatYuan” KnowX
- 3 layers: application, middle, foundation 
- AI 1 to AI 2 (like: from discover electricity to electrical network) 
- Chinese “AI-music” demo
- Chinese “AI-games” demo

## Using Lean for teaching
In the 2018–19 academic year, I taught Imperial’s introduction to proof course again, this time using Lean live in the lectures for some of the proofs. For example, I proved that a composite of surjective functions was surjective in Lean, I proved various results about equivalence relations in Lean, and I proved Cantor’s diagonal argument in Lean. I wrote the code live during the lectures, projecting my laptop onto the screen, but I also circulated “traditional” proofs in the course notes afterwards. All of this was done under the watchful eye of Athina Thoma, a specialist in mathematical education, who interviewed and surveyed the students and is writing up her conclusions for a forthcoming publication with Paola Iannone, another such specialist based in Loughborough. This approach was completely new to both me and the students, and I note with interest that their performance on the (conceptually complicated) question about binary relations on the end of year exam was done very well. Of course one has to be careful here; not all the students will want to see mathematics being done with computers, and of course these students should not be disadvantaged by such an approach. However I did think it was important that the students learnt, as early as possible, what a logical argument looked like, and how a logical argument is something which can be explicitly checked by an algorithm. This is not how mathematics is taught in schools but it seems to me to be a crucial message which an introduction to proof course in a mathe- matics department should convey. Patrick Massot is also using Lean in the mathematics department at Orsay, in his introduction to proof course.

On Thursday evenings during term time I run a Lean club at Imperial called the Xena Project (with asso- ciated blog at xenaproject.wordpress.com), where undergraduates learn to formalize the mathematics which they are learning in lectures, and any other mathematics of interest to them. One purpose of the project is to make knowledge of formalisation more prevalent amongst the undergraduate community, just as knowledge of LaTeX now is. Another purpose is an ongoing project to completely digitise the pure mathematics part of Imperial’s undergraduate curriculum.

I have also used Lean for outreach, showing schoolkids how to prove things like 2 + 2 = 4 from the axioms of Peano arithmetic and then raising the question of how much more mathematics can be done like this.

## Using Lean to help with research?
Currently, the only thing that Lean can offer the researcher is a “certificate” that any theorem they have formalized in Lean is indeed correct. Many humans feel that they do not need this certificate. I find it interesting that more and more mathematics relies on unpublished work; talk to any pure mathematician in any big area and they will know of some theorems which rely on results in the “grey literature” (a letter or an email from X to Y) or even results which are not in the literature at all (“a forthcoming paper”, sometimes announced years ago and which never came forth). 

Humans are good at forgetting to go back and fill in these details. Lean will not let you forget. The computer-generated red squiggly line underneath your theorem reminds you that your proof is not complete, even if your work relies on results announced by others and hence “it is not your job to complete it”. During our work formalizing perfectoid spaces, it got to the point where I knew “we had done it”, but until the definition compiled we knew we had not convinced Lean. Another issue is the fact that formalising the proof of a big theorem like Fermat’s Last Theorem, given the state of the art, would surely take more than 100 person-years. Getting money for this would involve a grant proposal which no grant agency would fund, and which would yield a result which no mathematician would care about anyway — we all know Fermat’s Last Theorem is true, because we know the experts have accepted the result.

* *Because Lean is offering something that pure mathematics researchers do not generally want (a fully formalized verification of their theorems) at a price which researchers generally will not pay (the time taken to learn how to use the software, and then the time taken to formalize their own proofs), in practice one has to rule this out as a viable practical application of these tools at this point in time. Things might change in the future, but rather than speculate on how good computers can or will become at understanding natural language (i.e., arXiv preprints), let me simply observe that currently they are nowhere near good enough, and instead turn to other things.* *

Already computer scientists are trying to develop tools which can actually do mathematics better than humans. They want to train their AI on databases — but these databases are few and far between, and several of the databases which are used in practice are databases of solutions to gigantic logic puzzles which bear no relation to modern mathematics. I believe that it is up to us as a community to explain to computer scientists what we are actually doing, in a format which is more useful to them than tens of thousands of arXiv preprints where we use words like “normal” and “complete” to mean five different things and where we write in the idiomatic and bizarre English language, thus adding another layer of obfuscation to the material. Formalisation solves this problem — it makes us say what we mean in a clear and coherent manner. This is what these people need to make tools for us — and we are not giving it to them. Mathematicians do not seem to have any desire to formalise a proof of Fermat’s Last Theorem, however computer scientists are desperate to train their AI’s on a formalised proof, to see how much further they can take things. If any mathematician reading this decides that they would be interested in taking up the challenge of formalising the statement of one of their theorems in Lean, then they can find me at the Zulip lean chat.

Computer scientists do not understand a lot of what we as mathematical researchers do, or how we do it. Let’s tell them in their own language, and see what happens next. Computer scientists have developed tools which can eat mathematics, but until these tools get more self-sufficient they will need to be hand-fed. It will be very interesting to see what these tools become as they grow.
