# DRAFT PROPOSAL FOR AMS REGIONAL---FRESNO, CA
Title: ChatGPT or ChatGPA? Exploring the role of AI in problem-solving and posing

In the following session, an algebraist (Zheng Yang) and a mathematics educator (Todd Edwards) explore classic recreational mathematics tasks (e.g., Lewis Carroll's Cats and Rats Problem) using ChatGPT and GeoGebra. 

As others have noted, ChatGPT is a language tool, not a computational engine. As such, ChatGPT generates genuinely interesting results when asked to solve mathematical tasks. "ChatGPT sometimes delivers insightful answers that would be a credit to an excellent Ph.D. student. Other times, however, it makes idiotic and obnoxious mistakes" (Thagard, 2023). Drawing on a vast collection of writing samples, ChatGPT relies on pattern recognition to predict what utterances are most probable. These writing samples include incorrect results that are, in turn, reflected in ChatGPT responses. 

Critics of ChatGPT (and AI, in general) point to faulty responses as evidence that ChatGPT has no place in learning classrooms. Such criticisms mistake ChatGPT as an answer generator (i.e., "ChatGPA") rather than as a learning partner---one that requires a human capable of asking useful questions in order to generate productive responses. Herein lies our challenge---First, to empower our students to ask more and better questions; and, Secondly, to help students learn how to communicate productively with the AI.

In our interactive session, we'll explore the notion of ChatGPT as a learning partner. More specifically, we'll ask ChatGPT to respond to audience-generated questions. And we'll generate code and incorporate it in sample GeoGebra sketches. Moreover, we'll brainstorm ways to use ChatGPT with our students to promote conceptual understanding and deep thinking. At the end of the session, participants will have: (1) a better understanding of ChatGPT including its strengths and limitations, (2) a better sense of how to engage ChatGPT to generate productive output, and (3) ideas for incorporating ChatGPT with students in their own classrooms.

This repository contains prompts for use with ChatGPT when exploring mathematics content.
We want to look for ways to use GPT and its variants to help us better understand mathematics.
