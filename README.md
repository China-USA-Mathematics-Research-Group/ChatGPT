Now it's 2019, and what have lmperial maths undergraduates formalised in Lean?
1. The theorem of quadratic reciprocity.
2. Sylow's theorems
3. the fundamental theorem of algebra0
4. matrices and bilinear maps.
5. the theory of localisation of rings,
6. the sine, cosine and exponential functionstensor products of modules.
7. Lots and lots of other undergraduate and MSc level things

# How Will AI Change Mathematics? (Castelvecchi---March 2, 2023)
AI tools already help formulate new theories and solve problems. But they’re set to shake up maths even more.

# CHATGPT+GeoGebra Video
Rather than generating GeoGebra code with ChatGPT, I think a more realistic use of the software is to open GeoGebra next to ChatGPT and ask ChatGPT to provide GeoGebra steps to help explain concepts. For instance, I had a very engaging time tonight asking ChatGPT to explain slope to me using GeoGebra. As I use the tool, I can't help feeling that I'm talking to a precocious child who needs help explaining. We literally need to teach ChatGPT how to talk to students ("slow down!" "One step at a time, please."). Fascinating stuff.

# DRAFT PROPOSAL FOR AMS REGIONAL---FRESNO, CA
Title: ChatGPT or ChatGPA? Exploring the role of AI in problem-solving and posing

In the following session, an algebraist (Zheng Yang) and a mathematics educator (Todd Edwards) explore classic recreational mathematics tasks (e.g., Lewis Carroll's Cats and Rats Problem) using ChatGPT and GeoGebra. 

As others have noted, ChatGPT is a language tool, not a computational engine. As such, ChatGPT generates genuinely interesting results when asked to solve mathematical tasks. "ChatGPT sometimes delivers insightful answers that would be a credit to an excellent Ph.D. student. Other times, however, it makes idiotic and obnoxious mistakes" (Thagard, 2023). Drawing on a vast collection of writing samples, ChatGPT relies on pattern recognition to predict what utterances are most probable. These writing samples include incorrect results that are, in turn, reflected in ChatGPT responses. 

Critics of ChatGPT (and AI, in general) point to faulty responses as evidence that ChatGPT has no place in learning classrooms. Such criticisms mistake ChatGPT as an answer generator (i.e., "ChatGPA") rather than as a learning partner---one that requires a human capable of asking useful questions in order to generate productive responses. Herein lies our challenge---First, to empower our students to ask more and better questions; and, Secondly, to help students learn how to communicate productively with the AI.

In our interactive session, we'll wrestle with these ideas as we engage ChatGPT as a learning partner. We'll ask ChatGPT to respond to audience-generated questions. We'll generate code and incorporate it in sample GeoGebra sketches. Moreover, we'll brainstorm ways to help our students learn how to communicate with AI productively, in order to build conceptual understanding of the mathematics they are studying. At the end of the session, participants will have: (1) a better understanding of ChatGPT, including its strengths and limitations; (2) a better sense of how to engage ChatGPT to generate productive output; and (3) ideas for incorporating ChatGPT with students in their own classrooms.

We want to look for ways to use GPT and its variants to help us better understand mathematics.
